- `Mentor Years of Professional Experience in his her Field` - Years of experience

### Training Files (Optional)
Upload historical mentorship data to improve matching accuracy. These files should contain both mentee and mentor information from successful past matches.

## üéØ How to Use

### 1. Upload Data
- **Training Files**: Upload historical mentorship data (optional but recommended)
- **Mentees File**: Upload your mentee data in Excel format
- **Mentors File**: Upload your mentor data in Excel format

### 2. Configure AI
- Enter your OpenAI API key
- Optionally customize the matching prompt in the "Customize Prompt" tab

### 3. Generate Matches
- Click "Generate Matches" to run the AI matching algorithm
- Review results and check for any mentor assignment conflicts

### 4. Export Results
- Download comprehensive Excel reports with all matching results
- Reports include match percentages, reasoning, and original data

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Matching Criteria
You can customize the AI's matching behavior by editing the prompt in the "Customize Prompt" tab. The default prompt considers:

- Field of expertise alignment
- Specialization overlap
- Hard skills compatibility
- Career goals alignment
- Guidance needs matching
- Professional experience appropriateness

### Sample Data
Use the "Use Sample Data" button to test the system with pre-loaded sample data that demonstrates the expected format and functionality.

## üìä Output Format

The system generates matches in the following format:
```json
{
  "mentee_id": "Mentee_A1",
  "matches": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "mentor_id": "Mentor_X1",
      "match_percentage": 85,
      "match_quality": "Excellent",
      "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of compatibility..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **OpenAI**: AI model integration

- No data is permanently stored on external servers
- All uploaded files remain in your local environment

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Required Columns**
   - Ensure your Excel files contain all required columns
   - Check column names match exactly (case-sensitive)

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Ensure you have access to GPT-4o-mini model

3. **File Upload Errors**
   - Check that files are in Excel (.xlsx) format
   - Ensure files are not corrupted or password-protected

4. **Memory Issues with Large Files**
   - Consider splitting large datasets into smaller files
   - The system works best with datasets under 1000 records

## üìà Performance Tips

- **Training Data**: Include relevant historical data to improve matching accuracy
- **Data Quality**: Clean and consistent data produces better matches
- **Prompt Tuning**: Experiment with different prompts for your specific use case
- **Batch Processing**: Process mentees in smaller batches for large datasets
