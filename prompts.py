MISSION: Match mentees with mentors across ALL academic and professional disciplines 
for international career acceleration through expert guidance.

Program Coverage: Life Sciences, Engineering, Computer Science, Business, Economics, 
Social Sciences, Humanities, Design, Environmental Sciences, and all professional fields


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - READ FIRST ⚠️
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. COMPLETENESS: You MUST return scores for EVERY mentee-mentor combination
   - If you receive 50 mentors and 100 mentees, you MUST return 50 × 100 = 5,000 scores
   - NEVER skip a combination, even if it's a terrible match
   - Bad matches should score 5-40%, NOT be omitted
   - Missing combinations will be filled with 30% (poor match), which defeats our purpose

2. CALCULATION METHOD: Follow this sequence for EACH pair:
   Step 1: Calculate field alignment points (0-40) using the matrix below
   Step 2: Count specialization keyword matches (0-30)
   Step 3: Evaluate expertise relevance (0-20)
   Step 4: Check education qualification (0-10)
   Step 5: Sum the points = subtotal
   Step 6: Apply caps if needed (different fields → max 40%, no keywords → max 55%)
   Step 7: Final score = min(subtotal, applicable_cap)

3. FIELD MATCHING IS STRICT: Use ONLY the field compatibility matrix provided
   - Do NOT invent relationships between fields
   - If two fields are not listed as related → 0 points
   - "Can benefit from" or "might be relevant" = 0 points (we need direct matches)

4. KEYWORD MATCHING IS LITERAL: Count actual word overlaps
   - "protein crystallography" vs "protein structure" = 1 match ("protein")
   - "electrochemistry" vs "immunotherapies" = 0 matches
   - Ignore common words (and, the, in, of, research, analysis, study, development)
   - Only count technical/domain-specific terms

{FIELD_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_TEXT}
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING RUBRIC (0-100 scale) - APPLY MATHEMATICALLY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A. FIELD ALIGNMENT (40 points) - USE THE MATRIX ABOVE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Compare {MENTEE_COLUMNS['field']} vs {MENTOR_COLUMNS['field']}

⚠️ DO NOT use reasoning like "can benefit from" or "might be relevant"
⚠️ ONLY award points if the pairing is EXPLICITLY in the matrix above
⚠️ If not in the matrix → 0 points

Example:
✅ Chemistry vs Chemistry → 40 points (identical)
✅ Chemistry vs Chemical Engineering → 30 points (in matrix)
✅ Chemistry vs Biology → 10 points (adjacent via Biochemistry)
❌ Chemistry vs Molecular Life Sciences → 0 points (NOT in matrix)
❌ Chemistry vs Immunology → 0 points (NOT in matrix)

⚠️ MANDATORY CAP: If Field Alignment = 0 points → FINAL SCORE CANNOT EXCEED 40%
   Even if other factors sum to 60 points, cap the final result at 40%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
B. SPECIALIZATION MATCH (30 points) - COUNT KEYWORDS LITERALLY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Extract technical keywords from both specialization fields and COUNT overlaps:
{MENTEE_COLUMNS['specialization']} keywords vs {MENTOR_COLUMNS['specialization']} keywords

Steps:
1. Remove common words: and, the, in, of, to, for, with, research, analysis, study, development, using, based, methods
2. Extract remaining technical terms (usually 3-8 words per specialization)
3. Count exact or near-exact matches (e.g., "protein" = "proteins", "crystallography" = "crystallographic")
4. Award points based on count:
   • 5+ matching keywords: 30 points
   • 3-4 matching keywords: 20 points
   • 1-2 matching keywords: 10 points
   • 0 matching keywords: 0 points

⚠️ DO NOT award points for "thematically similar" or "could be related"
⚠️ ONLY count actual word/term overlaps

Examples:
✅ "protein crystallography X-ray diffraction" vs "crystallography protein structure analysis"
   Matches: protein, crystallography → 2 keywords → 10 points

❌ "electrochemistry battery materials" vs "immunotherapies cancer treatment"
   Matches: (none) → 0 keywords → 0 points

⚠️ MANDATORY CAP: If Specialization Match = 0 points → FINAL SCORE CANNOT EXCEED 55%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
C. MENTOR EXPERTISE → MENTEE NEEDS (20 points)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Does {MENTOR_COLUMNS['specialization']} address {MENTEE_COLUMNS['guidance_areas']} and {MENTEE_COLUMNS['career_goals']}?

Consider:
• Mentor's technical specialization vs mentee's guidance needs
• Mentor's {MENTOR_COLUMNS['current_position']} relevance to mentee's career goals
• Any additional context from {MENTEE_COLUMNS['other_info']}

Scoring:
• Mentor's expertise directly addresses 80%+ of mentee's needs: 20 points
• Addresses 50-80% of needs: 12 points
• Addresses 30-50% of needs: 6 points
• Addresses <30% of needs: 0 points

⚠️ "Direct addressing" means technical expertise overlap, not general mentorship
⚠️ Current position helps assess if mentor can guide on specific career paths

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
D. EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE (10 points)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Mentor's {MENTOR_COLUMNS['education_level']} ≥ Mentee's {MENTEE_COLUMNS['education_level']}: 5 points
• Mentor's {MENTOR_COLUMNS['experience_years']} ≥ 5 years: 5 points

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CALIBRATION EXAMPLES (FOLLOW THESE PATTERNS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🟢 EXAMPLE 1: EXCELLENT MATCH (85-95%)
Mentee: Biology | Specialization: "protein folding, molecular dynamics"
Mentor: Molecular Biology | Specialization: "protein structure, folding dynamics"

CALCULATION:
Field: Biology vs Molecular Biology = HIGHLY RELATED = 30 points
Specialization: "protein folding molecular dynamics" vs "protein structure folding dynamics"
  → Matches: protein, folding, dynamics = 3 keywords = 20 points
Expertise: Directly addresses = 20 points
Education: Qualified = 10 points
TOTAL: 30 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 80 points
Caps: None apply
FINAL SCORE: 80%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🟡 EXAMPLE 2: GOOD MATCH (60-75%) - BASED ON YOUR ACTUAL DATA
Mentee: Bioinformatics | Specialization: "type 2 diabetes, computational modeling, personalized medicine"
Mentor: Medicine (Cardiorenal Physiology) | Specialization: "diabetes, cardiovascular disease, patient outcomes"

CALCULATION:
Field: Bioinformatics vs Medicine = RELATED (see matrix) = 20 points
Specialization: "diabetes" overlaps + "medicine"/"patient" themes = 2 keywords = 10 points
Expertise: Diabetes research directly addresses mentee's diabetes focus = 20 points
Education: Qualified = 10 points
TOTAL: 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 points
Caps: None apply (has keyword matches)
FINAL SCORE: 60%

⚠️ NOTE: This should score 60-70%, NOT 30% like in your test. If still scoring low, field pairing may not be in matrix.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 EXAMPLE 3: POOR MATCH (5-20%) - BASED ON YOUR ACTUAL DATA
Mentee: Environmental Sciences | Specialization: "conservation, biodiversity, climate change"
Mentor: Pharmacy (Industrial) | Specialization: "drug manufacturing, quality control, pharmaceutical production"

CALCULATION:
Field: Environmental Sciences vs Pharmacy = NOT IN MATRIX = 0 points
Specialization: No keyword overlap ("conservation" ≠ "pharmaceutical") = 0 points
Expertise: Cannot address conservation/climate needs = 0 points
Education: Qualified = 10 points
TOTAL: 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 10 points
Caps: Different fields → max 40% cap (but we're already at 10%)
FINAL SCORE: 10%

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a bad match, but we STILL INCLUDE IT in the output with 10-15%
⚠️ DO NOT omit this combination from your response
⚠️ This matches your bad match example and should score 10-20%, NOT 30%

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 EXAMPLE 4: TERRIBLE MATCH (5-15%) - STILL INCLUDE THIS SCORE
Mentee: Computer Science | Specialization: "machine learning, neural networks"
Mentor: Medicine | Specialization: "cardiology, clinical trials"

CALCULATION:
Field: Computer Science vs Medicine = DIFFERENT = 0 points
Specialization: No overlap = 0 points
Expertise: Cannot address technical CS needs = 0 points
Education: Has PhD but in wrong field = 5 points
TOTAL: 0 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 5 points
Caps: Different fields → max 40% cap (but we're already at 5%)
FINAL SCORE: 5%

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Include this score. Do NOT skip it. Bad matches need low scores, not omission.
